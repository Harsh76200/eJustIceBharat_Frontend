## How to Contribute

## Issue Guidelines

- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

- If you're interested in working on an issue, comment on it to let others know.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Address One Issue Per PR**: Each PR should address a single issue or feature to keep reviews focused.
2. **Branch Naming**: Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `fix-login-bug` or `add-auth-feature`.
3. **Descriptive Title**: Give your PR a clear title that describes the change.
4. **Link to Issues**: Reference any relevant issue(s) in your PR description using `#issue-number`.
5. **Wait for Review**: After submitting, please wait for feedback and respond to any requested changes.

## Coding Standards

- Use **ES6** syntax and features.
- Follow **React conventions**: components in PascalCase, hooks prefixed with `use`, etc.
- **Styling**: Stick to consistent styles. Use Styled Components or CSS Modules where applicable.
- **Linting**: Ensure code passes all linting and formatting checks.

## Commit Messages

- **Format**: Write clear, concise messages with the format:
- Example: `fix(auth): resolve login redirection issue`
- Types: `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`
